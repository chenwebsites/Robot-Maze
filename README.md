# Robot-Maze

This problem solved using the approach of "touching" the left wall at all times.
There are a few pre-conditions that we guarantee the success of the exit of the robot from the maze: 
1. I assume the robot begins his walk from the first square at (6,0).
2. After The robot enter the maze, the entrence becomes a wall.
3. I assume for each maze, there is an exit.

If the maze follows the above pre conditions, I can guarantee that the robot will find the exit.
